#### **Key Features** 
- **Dynamic Schema Handling:** Define table schemas using JSON files and dynamically generate Backend, Database and FrontEnd for CRUD operations.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.
- **Effortless Setup:** Use provided batch files for Windows or simple commands for other OS to set up the project quickly.
- **Automatic Frontend Setup:** Automatically creates a frontend codebase in the public directory.
#### **Technologies Used** 
- **Node.js:** Leveraging the power of JavaScript on the server-side.
- **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework for building robust APIs.
- **SQLite:** A lightweight, file-based database for efficient data storage.
- **npm:** The package manager for Node.js used for installing project dependencies.

### <a name="BackEnd"></a>## **BackEnd** 🚀

1. Delete all the folders starting with bin ( which is the BackEnd code).

2. node .\KCode\ForBatV11\Backend.js
   
3. Now all the bin folders only are created ( which is the BackEnd code).

ready with only flat json 

if want to run the repo without npm 

BoilerPlate.bat -npm 

the below steps avoids, npm installation, there by saving internet bandwidth.

Purpose of this project

at the root location KCode

DataSchema define your schema

crudBDGenerator/Config.json is the configuration file

the meaning of the repo

24 Feb 2024

added support for reference or foreign key of the database, and tested it with 320 in sqlite

in kcode config.json is keep in kcode root for much more cleaner look of the code


for mock testing the end points:

### <a name="vscodeextensions"></a>## **visual studio code extensions** 🚀

for est client or http calling

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client

code runner for executing batch files and js files

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner


for Backend :

root : bin folder the code is generated from 

when running the file from kcode/Backend.js

for Database :

root : KData/JSON folder the code is generated from 

when running the file from kcode/Database.js

it takes the configuration file ( config.json )

and it takes the data path also from that file only
